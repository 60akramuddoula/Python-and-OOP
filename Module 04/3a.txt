Lists are ordered collections, while dictionaries are unordered collections.
Lists are accessed by index, while dictionaries are accessed by keys.
Lists are used for ordered collections of items, while dictionaries are used for key-value pairs where quick access to values using keys is needed.
Lists use square brackets [], while dictionaries use curly braces {} and key-value pairs.
Lists can contain duplicate elements, while dictionary keys must be unique.
